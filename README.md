# multisite
Library of Estimators of Treatment-effect Heterogeneity across sites in multi-site random experiments with few units per site.
multisite wraps in four commands to estimate treatment-effect heterogeneity across sites in multi-site RCTs, and more generally in stratified RCTs.
multisite_varITT computes the estimated variance of ITTs across sites in multi-site randomized trials.
multisite_varLATE computes the estimated variance of LATEs across sites in multi-site randomized trials.
multisite_regITT computes the coefficients from a regression of site-level ITTs on site-level characteristics in multi-site randomized trials.
multisite_regLATE estimates the sign of univariate regression coefficients from regressions of site-level LATEs on site-level characteristics in multi-site randomized trials.
